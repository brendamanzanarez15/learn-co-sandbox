         Amy Hennig has worked in the video game since the late 1980's.
       <br>
       Most of her early jobs had Nintendo games involved.
       <br>
       She was employed as an animator and artist.
       <br>
       She feels that once game writers focus on creative 
       <br>
       expressions, video games will greatly improve and focusing
       <br>
       too much on graphics can inhibit a game.
       <br>
       Amy likes to use supporting characters to highlight
       <br>
       personality aspects through interactions within the script.
       <br>
       Amy Hennig worked on the Uncharted series on the 
       <br>
       Play Station 3 making the population stare speachless at
       <br>
       her work with unbelievable graphics.

        Amy Hennig was a part of the staff that created the Uncharted series.
        <br>
        The series didnt recieve much attention due to The Last Of Us
        <br>
        and Left Behind. The staff working on Uncharted was very small compared to 
        <br> 
        the others and wasn't expected to have a great success but became very popular
        <br>
        after the release date. the staff working on Uncharted didn't recieve the
        <br>
        resources needed to survive. Some found the situation understandable but 
        <br>
        others didnt agree and wished for a more cohesive direction.
        <br> 
        The game survived and recieved lots of attenton after its release date.
